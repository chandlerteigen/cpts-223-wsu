 * Description: Program to satisfy the requiremnts of PA2 for CPTS 223 Fall 2019
 *              This code benchmarks several algorithms which compute the maximum
 *              subsequence of a list of integers. The data is outputted into a .csv file
 *              called test_output.csv
 * 
 * Credit:      The 4 algorithms used are from Weiss C++ data structures textbook.
 *              All other code was written myself
